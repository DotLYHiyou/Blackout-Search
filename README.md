## What is it?
A proxy built to last against Internet Censorship tools. If you fork Blackout Search, star it. Most people who fork my projects dont star it.
## How do I use it?
Go to ZenithHub and use it there. Or deploy this repository to any static host.
## What if it breaks?
Open an issue and specify your problem.
## Can I contribute?
Sure, why not? Go for it. I'll be checking each pull request for vulnerabilities, so no funny business.
